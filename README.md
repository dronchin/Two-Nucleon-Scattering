# Two Nucleon Scattering #

This project is completed in requirement for PHY524 Quantum Mechanics II at Washington University in St. Louis

Under Src, you will find a jupyter notebook running python3.
-> Requirements: python3, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

Under Report, you will find a report briefly describing our findings. There will be a source file for LaTex as well.


## Problem: ##
Consider two nucleons each of mass m=938 MeV/c^2
interacting via a central potential given by an attractive rectangular well.
where V_0 is positive and R=1.45 fm.

This project sets out to explore this scattering problem numerically.
- Numerov's algorithm will be used to numerically calculate the scattered wavefunctions.
- The phase shifts will be calculated using the wavefunctions for different angular momentum scattering values.
- The phase shifts are used to calculate the total cross section as a function of energy, showing the contribution from different partial wave scattering.
